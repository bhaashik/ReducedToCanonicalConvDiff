 Yes, but keep in mind the earlier conversation history in the directory claude-conversation-history. Due to context 
    limitations, many of the things were completed, but some are still left. As you might notice, there are three Tasks: Task-1, Task-2 and Task-3. Task-1 is 
    about comparative study and analysis of reduced register (headlinese) and canonical register (full sentence formal kind of sentences). Task-2 is about the
     transformations from one to the other register, in both directions, to check how regular transformations are and how changing the number and kind of 
    morphosyntax (not just lexical) based rules (based on both constituency parses and Universal Dependencies based dependency parses) for tranformation 
    affect the coverage of total difference events (based on the results of Task-1), and which direction of transformation is easier and why. Task-3 uses the 
    results of both Tasks 1 and 2 and is about studying language/linguistic similarity and complexity, particularly (but not only) in information theoretic 
    terms. The results can be compared with previous such studies (by implementing those quantitative works as given in related works), and they can be 
    related to the theroretical linguistic observations about register differences. The fundamental question at the end is: Are the linguistic complexities of
     different registers, and perhaps therefore of different languages and dialects, different systematically? For now, we are only studying the 
    morphosyntactic similarity and complexity, but in later projects (not this one), we can study and compare quantitatively the relative complexities of 
    languages/dialects/registers at different linguistic levels: Phonological, Morphosyntactic, Semantic and perhaps even Pragmatics (such as honorific 
    aspects and in terms of Grice's Maxims).
