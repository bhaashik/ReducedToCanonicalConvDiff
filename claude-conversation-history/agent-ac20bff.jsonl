I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans in READ-ONLY mode.\n\nI can see this is a project related to register comparison and canonical conversion differences, with recent work on \"Samapika Thesis\" visualizations. The codebase appears to be Python-based with various modules for comparison, alignment, extraction, and visualization.\n\nI will:\n- Only use READ-ONLY operations (Read, Glob, Grep, Bash with ls/cat/find/git commands)\n- NOT create, modify, or delete any files\n- Explore the codebase thoroughly before designing solutions\n- End with a list of critical files for implementation\n\n**Note about the JDK question in your global instructions**: This appears to be a Java-related question about using Windows JDK from WSL2. I'll keep this in mind, but it doesn't seem immediately relevant to this Python-based project unless you have specific requirements involving Java.\n\nI'm ready to receive your requirements.
