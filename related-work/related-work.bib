    pages = "7922--7935",
    abstract = "This corpus study examines how humans compress information in single-sentence summaries. The researchers discovered that summaries feature morphological expansion, increased lexical diversity, and similar positional arrangements compared to source texts. Notably, their human evaluation revealed misalignment---summary writers employ linguistic strategies that readers prefer, yet their lexical and word-specificity choices don't match reader preferences."

Rather than viewing headlinese as existing outside linguistic conventions, the author argues it constitutes a norm in itself which actually builds on the very potentialities of Standard English."

    abstract = "The authors present a tree-to-tree transduction method for sentence compression utilizing synchronous tree substitution grammar. Their approach addresses structural mismatches by enabling local distortion of the tree topology. The paper describes both a decoding algorithm and a discriminative training method within a large margin framework, demonstrating significant improvements over a state-of-the-art model."
