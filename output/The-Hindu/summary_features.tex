\hline
Feature ID & Mnemonic & Description \\
\hline
FW-DEL & FW-DEL & Deletion of function words from the reduced register relative to the canonical. \\
FW-ADD & FW-ADD & Addition of function words in canonical relative to headline. \\
C-DEL & C-DEL & Deletion of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) in reduced register. \\
C-ADD & C-ADD & Addition of content words in canonical form. \\
POS-CHG & POS-CHG & Part-of-speech changes between aligned tokens. \\
LEMMA-CHG & LEMMA-CHG & Lemma differences in aligned tokens. \\
FORM-CHG & FORM-CHG & Orthographic or inflectional surface form differences. \\
PUNCT-DEL & PUNCT-DEL & Deletion of punctuation marks from the reduced register relative to the canonical. \\
PUNCT-ADD & PUNCT-ADD & Addition of punctuation marks in canonical form relative to headline. \\
PUNCT-SUBST & PUNCT-SUBST & Substitution between punctuation marks and function words. Headlines use punctuation to compensate for deleted function words (colon for conjunctions, comma for 'and', dash for relative clauses, quotes for reported speech markers). \\
FEAT-CHG & FEAT-CHG & Morphological feature differences extracted from Universal Dependencies Stanza parses. Includes all granular morphological features: Tense, Number, Aspect, Voice, Mood, Case, Degree, Person, Gender, Definiteness, PronType, Possessive, NumType, NumForm, Polarity, Reflexive, VerbForm, Abbreviation, ExtPos, Foreign. \\
DEP-REL-CHG & DEP-REL-CHG & Change in dependency relation labels (and possibly heads). \\
HEAD-CHG & HEAD-CHG & Token keeps same dependency label but head changes. \\
TOKEN-REORDER & TOKEN-REORDER & Changes in linear order of individual tokens. \\
CONST-REM & CONST-REM & Removal of whole syntactic constituents. \\
CONST-ADD & CONST-ADD & Addition of whole syntactic constituents. \\
CONST-MOV & CONST-MOV & Movement of an entire constituent to a new position. \\
CLAUSE-TYPE-CHG & CLAUSE-TYPE-CHG & Changes in clause type or finiteness. \\
H-STRUCT & H-STRUCT & Overall structural classification of headlines based on discourse complexity. \\
H-TYPE & H-TYPE & Classification of headlines by completeness of predication. \\
F-TYPE & F-TYPE & Classification of fragment types (only applies when H-TYPE = fragment). \\
TREE-DEPTH-DIFF & TREE-DEPTH-DIFF & Difference in parse tree depth between canonical and headline forms (both constituency and dependency). \\
CONST-COUNT-DIFF & CONST-COUNT-DIFF & Difference in number of syntactic constituents between canonical and headline constituency parses. \\
DEP-DIST-DIFF & DEP-DIST-DIFF & Difference in average dependency distance between canonical and headline dependency parses. \\
BRANCH-DIFF & BRANCH-DIFF & Difference in average branching factor between canonical and headline parse trees. \\
VERB-FORM-CHG & VERB-FORM-CHG & Verb form changes independent of POS category shifts. Note: VerbForm feature changes are also captured in FEAT-CHG. \\
TED & TED & Tree edit distance between constituency parses. \\
LENGTH-CHG & LENGTH-CHG & Difference in tokens/constituents between forms. \\
TOKEN-COUNT-DIFF & TOKEN-COUNT-DIFF & Difference in number of tokens between canonical and headline forms. \\
CHAR-COUNT-DIFF & CHAR-COUNT-DIFF & Difference in character count between canonical and headline forms. \\
