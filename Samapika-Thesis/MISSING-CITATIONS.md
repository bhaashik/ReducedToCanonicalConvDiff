2.1 Prior Linguistic Treatments of Headlines 

I found §2.1 Linguistic Works on News Headlines puzzling and disappointing. The author cites a range of publications but to my mind most of these touch upon the syntax of headlines only in passing. Moreover prominent papers and dissertations that deal with headlines are not considered. I find this odd because in less than an hour of googling for syntax headlines, headlinese syntax, headlines parsing and other such obvious keywords, I was able to uncover a significant amount of literature and resources that the author seems to be unaware of. For example there is an entire dissertation on the syntax of headlines from 1974 from the prestigious School of Oriental and African Studies in London. (A Syntactic Study of British English Press Headlines by A. El-Bakri, https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/28658/1/10672818.pdf). 

There are also more recent studies and dissertations on headlines in German, in Dutch, and in English. 



Here are a few citations that showed up right away.

Page 64, I am not convinced by the claims about ambiguity at least not based on these examples.

There is high quality work on headlines and it is easily accessible in prominent journals.

On a different note, §2.1 reads like a list. We do not learn much about the syntactic properties of headlines as discovered by prior authors. I suspect this is in part because the author picked on a rather disparate set of papers that didn't primarily concern themselves with the syntax of headlines. I had a similar feeling from $2.2, which concerns itself with prior computational work. I feel I got very little out of Chapter 2 as a whole..
