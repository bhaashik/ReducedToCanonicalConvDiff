"Feature (from comparison data)","Theoretical Principle / Explanation","Linguistic Register Concept"
"Function word omission (tokens deleted)","Headlines omit function words like determiners, auxiliaries, pronouns to reduce redundancy and maximize information density.","Telegraphic/Reduced Register: Economy of expression under channel constraints"
"Token reordering events","Frequent non-canonical word orders reflect topicalization, focus on new or salient information at sentence start or reordered components for emphasis.","Information Structure / Foregrounding: Highlighting important info, background suppression"
"Form, lemma, and POS changes","Use of nominalization, gerunds, or conversion of verbs to nouns to condense phrases, or shift verb classes for brevity.","Morphosyntactic Simplification & Nominalization: Common in headlines to condense events"
"Feature (morphological) changes","Reduction or simplification of morphological inflection (e.g., tense, agreement) to shorten constructions and convey present/factual immediacy.","Morphological Economy: Fewer inflections signal compressed temporal/aspectual info"
"Dependency relation (deprel) changes","Structural simplification, such as omitting modifiers or subordination, reduces syntactic complexity.","Syntactic Simplification / Parataxis: Preference for simpler, coordinate relations over complex embedding"
"Tokens added in canonical but missing in reduced","Canonical forms include function words, explicit arguments, subordinate clauses, reflecting fully realized, explicit syntax.","Full Sentence Register: Complete and explicit realization suitable for detailed description and clarity"
"Constituent phrase removals (constituents_deleted)","Omission of prepositional phrases, subordinate clauses in headlines reduces phrase complexity and length.","Phrase-Structure Compression: Pruning of non-core info for focus and brevity"
"Constituent phrase additions in canonical","Canonical sentences maintain full clause complements and modifiers, supporting richer semantic elaboration.","Register Complexity: Higher informational content via full syntactic structure"
"Tree Edit Distance (constituency)","Quantitative measure of global structural divergence; higher TEDs indicate headlines are more structurally reduced and rearranged compared to canonical.","Structural Divergence as Register Marker: Reduced register has compressed and reordered trees"
"Relative counts of added/removed words and tokens","Prevalence of omitted vs. retained elements reflects deliberate reduction characteristic of headline register.","Ellipsis and Inference Framework: Headlines rely on shared context and omission for efficient communication"
"Higher ratio of nouns and adjectives","Increased use of content words increases lexical density, signaling a focus on entities and salient descriptive information.","Lexical Density in Reduced Registers: More information packed per word to maximize impact"
"Omission of explicit agents and oblique arguments","Simplifies subject-agent relations, focusing newsheadlines on events rather than agents; often suppresses peripheral info.","Thematic Foregrounding: Event prominence over agent explicitness typical in news style"
