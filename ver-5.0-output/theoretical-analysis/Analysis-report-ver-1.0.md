# Yes, I do.

Great! Since you want me to help prepare a detailed, annotated report or presentation version of the feature-to-principle mapping, I can provide you with a structured, well-organized outline or a formatted document-like text that you can use for reports or presentations.

Here is a proposed structure with detailed explanations and clear annotations for each feature and its corresponding principle:

# Annotated Report: Feature-to-Principle Mapping for Differences Between Canonical and Reduced (Headline) Registers

## Introduction

This report summarizes the key linguistic features identified via dependency and constituency parse comparisons between canonical sentences and their reduced register forms (news headlines). Each feature is mapped to theoretical linguistic principles that explain why and how such differences arise in the headline register.

## 1. Function Word Omission

**Feature:**

- Significant deletion of function words such as determiners, auxiliaries, prepositions, and pronouns in headlines.
- Detected as “tokens_deleted” in dependency parses and “word_removed” in constituency analyses.

**Theoretical Principle:**

- Headlines exhibit **telegraphic style**, maximizing information density by omitting syntactically obligatory but pragmatically inferable items.
- Aligns with **register theory** emphasizing economy in informational channels with limited space (Halliday’s “mode” feature).

**Linguistic Register Concept:**

- Reduced register / telegraphic style in headlines is an adaptation to communication constraints.


## 2. Structural Simplification and Phrase Elision

**Feature:**

- Missing subordinate clauses, prepositional phrases, and complex constituents in headlines compared to canonical counterparts.
- Constituency trees show “constituents_removed” events; dependency trees show “dep_changes” and omitted modifiers.

**Theoretical Principle:**

- Simplification reduces processing load and focuses reader attention on core news content.
- Reflects **paratactic vs. hypotactic syntax** difference in reduced registers.

**Linguistic Register Concept:**

- Register-determined syntactic compression and foregrounding.


## 3. Word Order and Topicalization Changes

**Feature:**

- Events of token reordering and shifts in phrase structures are common in headlines.
- Highlights and focuses salient information early in the headline.

**Theoretical Principle:**

- Supports **functional sentence perspective** theories of topic and focus, restructuring sentence elements to maximize prominence.

**Linguistic Register Concept:**

- Pragmatic adaptation to attention economy; increased topicalization and front-loading in headlines.


## 4. Morphological and Lexical Changes

**Feature:**

- Increased use of nominalizations, reduced verb inflections, and POS changes.
- Detected as “lemma_changes,” “pos_changes,” and morphological feature differences.

**Theoretical Principle:**

- Morphological economy facilitates compression and compact expression of events.
- Increased lexical density shifts from predicate-heavy canonical sentences to noun-heavy headlines.

**Linguistic Register Concept:**

- Lexical compactness and nominalization in reduced registers are style markers of written news English.


## 5. Agent and Oblique Argument Suppression

**Feature:**

- Omission of explicit agent phrases or oblique arguments frequently seen in headlines.

**Theoretical Principle:**

- Event-focused discourse structure reduces peripheral information to highlight news facts.
- Reflects **thematic preference** and **information structure** focusing on what happened rather than who did it.

**Linguistic Register Concept:**

- Functional sentence perspective and discourse pragmatics guide such omissions.


## 6. Quantitative and Global Structural Metrics

**Feature:**

- Tree edit distance and global event count metrics quantify the degree of structural reduction and lexical changes.

**Theoretical Principle:**

- Provide objective measures linking syntactic and morphological reduction to register variation.
- Support hypothesis that headlines represent a systematically compressed and reorganized register.


## Conclusion and Implications

This mapping connects concrete parse-based linguistic features to well-established linguistic theory explaining headline register characteristics. The results emphasize the multi-layered syntactic, morphological, lexical, and pragmatic strategies used in reduced registers such as news headlines, highlighting register effects on language structure and use.

### Appendices or Presentation Slides

If you need, I can generate slide-ready bullet points based on each section, or provide graphical summaries linking features and principles visually.

Would you like me to prepare this in a specific document format (e.g., Markdown, LaTeX, PowerPoint outline), or include example sentences illustrating each feature? Also, I can help build a presentation with visuals and concise notes for each mapping. Just let me know how you want to proceed!
